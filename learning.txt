Throughout this course, I have learned how to use Git and GitHub to manage code, collaborate with others, and track changes using version control. I now understand how to clone repositories, make local changes, commit them, and push updates to remote repositories. These skills are essential for real-world software development, and I'm excited to keep improving.
