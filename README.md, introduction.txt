This is my first repository created as part of a GitHub learning task.# Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Yosef Temesgan. I am an enthusiastic learner with a deep interest in software development and technology. I enjoy exploring new programming tools and contributing to innovative projects.

I created this repository to begin my journey with GitHub and collaborate with the developer community while learning version control best practices.
